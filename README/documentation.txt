-This script calculates the rolling rank of future returns. This is what the model attempts to predict during the training phase to generate its "probabilities" or "ranks."

Script: src/ml_walkforward_train.py
-This is the ridge regression code.This is code filters for specific market regimes, specifically focusing only on "risk-on" periods defined by a long-term moving average to improve signal quality.
To ensure the model remains relevant over time, the system employs a rolling training window that iteratively learns from ten years of historical data to forecast the subsequent three years.
	- Training Window: 10-year rolling windows.
	- Testing Window: 3-year sliding windows.
	- Model Pipeline: A Ridge Regression pipeline that includes scaling and regularisation to prevent over-fitting.
	- Regime Constraint: The training and prediction logic are restricted to MA200 Risk-On regimes (Price > MA200), ensuring the model only seeks signals when market conditions are favorable
